# SpaceNotes Client

Flutter client for [SpaceNotes](https://github.com/mikaelwills/spacenotes) - an open-source self-hosted notes solution.

**An open-source attempt at the ideal notes solution.**

This project explores what note-taking could look like if you had full control: your own server, plain markdown files, real-time sync across all devices, and AI that can actually help you organize your thoughts. No vendor lock-in, no subscription fees, no compromises on privacy.

See the main repo for full documentation, setup instructions, and the Docker stack.
